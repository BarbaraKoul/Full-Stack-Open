### CI/CD Tools for C++

For a C++ project with a team of six people, choosing the right CI/CD tools is crucial. For the essential steps of **linting**, **testing**, and **building**, the following tools are recommended:

* **Linting:** **Clang-Tidy** is a powerful static analysis tool that identifies programming errors, style issues, and non-optimal practices. It's often used with **Clang-Format** for automated code formatting.
* **Testing:** For unit testing, **Google Test** is a popular choice, providing a robust framework for creating and running test cases. **CTest**, part of the CMake ecosystem, organizes and executes these tests.
* **Building:** **CMake** is the standard for build automation in C++. It generates build files (like Makefiles) from simple scripts, making the process easy and cross-platform.

### CI/CD Alternatives

Beyond **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**, several excellent alternatives are well-suited for a six-person team:

* **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated directly into the GitLab platform, it's very easy to use. You define your jobs in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for quick results.
* **CircleCI:** Offers quick setup, easy configuration, and broad support for various platforms and languages.
* **Travis CI:** Similar to CircleCI, it's one of the older CI/CD services known for its simplicity.

### Self-hosted vs. Cloud-hosted

The decision between a self-hosted and cloud-hosted environment depends on several factors.

A **self-hosted** environment provides **complete control** and **security** over your data. For a C++ project, this might be important if the application handles sensitive information or if the computational resources required are so large that a cloud solution would be too expensive.

A **cloud-hosted** environment, like **GitHub Actions**, is easier to set up and maintain, allowing the team to focus on development. It also offers **flexibility** and **scalability**, as you can easily adjust computing resources based on project needs.

To make an informed decision, you would need to consider the project's **security requirements**, your available **budget**, the team's **experience** with infrastructure management, and the overall **complexity** of the build processes.
