# Full Stack Open Seminar - University of Helsinki<br/>

## About <br/>
This repository is created for the needs of Full-Stack-Open Seminar of University of Helsinki. The course covers MERN Stack topics from easy to advanced level, organized in 14 parts. Parts 0-5 are the core of the course, while every of the next parts is an extension of the core course. Inside each folder of this repository there are all the exercises of the course demanded for a full-point certificate. The course has as prerequisites solid/proficient knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, how git and github work and basic concepts of programming. 

## Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web Development
This part is an introduction of how web applications work. Through **Mermaid-Syntax diagrams** the relationship between user, browser and server is depicted. In addition, the evolution from traditional to modern SP applications is presented. Hence, the *3 exercises* include:<br/>
-A diagram showing how a page loads in an SPA<br/>
-A diagram showing how a note is made in a note SPA<br/>
-A diagram showing how a note is made in a traditonal note app <br/>

## Part 1 - Introduction to React
In this part the fundamentals of React are presented. There is a thorough explanation of **JSX**, **State Variables**, **Event Handlers** and **component organization** of a web application's frontend. Also, there is an introduction on how **debugging** works on the frontend. These concepts are practically issued in the *3 exercises* in the Part 1 folder.<br/>

## Part 2 - Communication with the Server
This part covers how the browser communicates with the server through **Axios** library of **npm** and **JSON Server**. The concepts issued here is **rendering a collection**, how our code can be tidied up with **modules** and how we can use **Forms** for collecting data. We should not ommit the introduction to how **promises** work in asynchronous functions and the need of **Effect-hooks**. Basically, this part deepens on how **getting, sending and altering data to server** works in real web Apps. Finally, there is a reference on how **styling** apps works in React. <br/>

## Part 3 - Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express
This part is focused on the backend of web Applications, using **NodeJS** and **Express** library. Firstly, there is an analysis of **RESTful** applications, whereas there is a solid explanation of the **middleware** importance and usage, especially working with **Morgan** Tokens. Afterwards, the **Cors** library is presented for connecting frontend with backend and again, how debugging works, this time in backend. Familiriazation with tools such as **Postman** begins. How to use **Render** for app deployment in the internet and how **MongoDB** works are also in the list. Lastly, the tool **ESLint** is used for syntax errors.

## Part 4 - Testing Express Servers, User Administartion
**Testing Environment**, **Supertest** library, and **error-handling** are the basic concepts of this part. We learn how to use **async/await** syntax, eliminating try/catch syntax and how to **organize tests** with descibe and test-only. Also, **User administration, authorization and authentication** are referred to, implementing the **JWT Strategy** in a bloglist app.

## Part 5 - Testing React apps
In this part we implement the frontend of a login page and we first use **Local Storage**. We learn about **children components** and **Prop-Types**. We test our bloglist app about its frontend. **Debugging**, **snapshot tests**, **E2E testing(Playwright and Cypress).**
